  How many times have you wished that ProBoard would let you use the special
  keys like Escape and Return in your menus as hotkeys? How may different
  things have you tried? How many of them worked? Ah, none probably. Well,
  this little gem here is a program which will enable you to use escape and
  return as regular hotkeys in your menus.

  This is not a pex, nor it is a compilcated application. Interestingly
  enough, ProBoard recognizes the Escape and Return as valid hotkeys itself.
  The bad news is (was) that there was no way to put those keys using the
  menu editor. So what hKeys does, is simply to create menu items with the
  hotkey data already set for you. You simply fill in the blanks.

  Put hKeys.Exe somewhere in your path. You will probably want to use it
  over and over again (or maybe not). The program is tiny (10k) and does not
  occupy much space on your hard dirve. So, copy it somewhere where you can
  access it by simply typing 'hkeys' on the command prompt.

  You must have the PROBOARD environment set to point to your bbs system
  directory as per the User's Manual that came with your copy of ProBoard.
  This variable is used by hKeys to locate the MENUS subdirectory where all
  your menu files are located.

  This is it. Run hKeys without any parameters to get a quick reference.

  Generally, you need to specify at least two parameters for hKeys to work:

                  hkeys menu_file -return | -escape

  The first one is the name of the menu file(s) you want to modify. Note that
  you only need to specify the names that you see in the ProBoard menu editor
  (like GLOBAL, TOP, etc.). You can also use wildcards to specify multiple
  menu files. See the examples below of proper wildcard usage.

  The other thing you need to specify is the hotkey for the item that you
  will be creating. You can use '-return or -r' to create an item with the
  Return hotkey, and '-escape or -e' to create an item with an Escape key.
  You can specify both, in which case two items will be created: one for the
  Return and one for the Escape keys. You must specify at least one of these.

  Examples:
      hkeys top -r        : add a return hotkey item to the TOP menu
      hkeys global -r -e  : add return and escape items to the GLOBAL menu
      hkeys * -escape     : add an escape hotkey item to all menus

  hKeys simply appends one or more menu items to your already existing menus
  (note that the menus must have already been created with ProCFG before you
  run hKeys as this program will not make menus from scratch). The menu items
  that it creates are the same as the default ProBoard items - all fields
  except for the hotkey and the text line. The text in the text field will
  be as follows:

      "(escape) key item [generated by hKeys]"  <- Escape is the hotkey
      "(return) key item [generated by hKeys]"  <- Return is the hotkey

  You can safely delete this text as it is for identification purposes only
  and then edit the rest of the menu item like you normally would (without
  touching the hotkey, of course). Note that appending the item at the end
  of the menu is only a minor inconvenience if you want to posistion it
  differently. To move it, use the Copy and Paste functions of the ProBoard
  menu editor.

  hKeys uses an undocumented quirk of ProBoard to do its magic. Even though
  all versions up to v2.16b3 work with this scheme, I cannot guarantee that
  any of the future versions will. Use at your own risk. I am also not
  responsible for any corrupted menu (or other) files and data. Prudence
  dictates that you backup all files before attempting to modify them. I
  have used every precaution that I can possibly think of to prevent errors
  in this program, but I will not be liable for any damages its use or
  inability to use may cause you. For the full text of your License, read
  the file 'Copying.Doc' included with this manual.

  The source code (hKeys.Cpp) requires PB-Lib v3.0 or later to compile.
  This library is available separately from the same source as hKeys itself.
