INTRODUCTION
===========================================================================
	Before requesting support or contacting with problems, please be sure
	to read and understand the manual. Most problems are often due to
	incorrect data files and/or wrong command line parameters. Also, since
	most of the programs are free, requests for new features and fixes will
	be given low priority and work on them will be heavily dependent of
	time availability.

	In addition, ProBoard-specific files can be found on the following

	ftp://logical.ao.net
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		This is the home place for James Padgett's utilities (Logical
		Decisions Software). There is also a directory '/sci' which
		has all recent Silicon Creations, Inc. releases.

	ftp://pcmicro.com and http://pcmicro.com
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		This is Mike Ehlert's site. It has a very good RemoteAccess file
		base and a fast growing ProBoard support (since he switched to
		ProBoard). There is also a '/4_authors/sci' directory which has
		all recent Silicon Creations, Inc. releases.

	ftp://www.win.net/winnet/jamaddox
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		This is a general repository. Has a lot of files, but there is
		no easy way to find anything unless you know what you are looking
		for - everything is lumped in one directory. Courtesy of John
		Maddox. Uploads go to incoming/ (didn't work last time I checked)

	http://www.win-uk.net/~fe-line/
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		The official site for all Fe-line software releases. This is also
		the UK registration site for ProBoard. An interesting feature of
		this site is the "Author Direct" page for news from Philippe with
		regards to ProBoard development. This is also the home of the big
		ProBoard FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).

	http://www.dma.be/p/bewoner/jmj
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		The home site for all JMJ productions (most made by Ruben Provoost).
		This is the place where you will find the best chatter TheMin, as
		well as a lot of useful utilities (inluding the JMJLINE oneliner).

	ftp://silverado.cyberstation.net
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		This is the ftp site used by TGPBN (The Global ProBoard Network) for
		the InterNet file/echo bone. The directories that begin with 'pb'
		is where you want to look. The two directories dedicated to Silicon
		Creations releases are '/pbscibin' and '/pbscisrc'.


CONTACT NOTES
===========================================================================
	Support message conferences are available at Silicon Creations BBS.
	Note that there are dedicated sections for PB-Lib files/patches, etc.
	Also, there are file sections with A LOT of ProBoard related files.

	ProBoard-related problems are discussed in the PROBOARD Fidonet echo
	which I monitor. You can post a PEX-related problem there. You can also
	post messages to me in any of the TGPBN echo areas.

	Please note that I am a full-time student and as such there may be a
	delay in replying. I regret that, but there is nothing I can currently
	do about it. Sorry.

	All pex suggestions and bug reports can be sent by email or netmail,
	whichever you prefer. I will answer in the manner the original message
	was sent. Netmail may be an exception. I am known to make direct
	overseas calls if the message has a high priority and I will do that,
	as long as my resources permit it. However, I may reply via routed
	netmail in case the reply is not urgent. In that case, allow a couple
	of days for delivery. Also note that I do not like receiving InterNet
	email at my CompuServe address. I may not reply to those messages
	because I am charged for reading them (meaning, I may decide not to
	read them). Only use this address if you are a CompuServe member (in
	which case we're ok).

	A note for voice calls.	Remember that there's a time difference and
	of you are calling from Europe, make sure you are not trying to page
	me or talk to me in the middle of the night. Actually, late afternoon
	is the best time to call (this is in Central Standard Time). I do
	accept voice calls for software support (as lots of people know by now)
	but I really prefer email/netmail/echomail as it gives me an opportunity
	to go over the problem thoroughly and (in case of echomail), benefit
	more sysops with the reply.
