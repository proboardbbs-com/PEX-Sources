This is the readme file for the Bulletin Manager source code package.

Even though BULMAN was developed with Borland C++ 3.1, it should be easy
to compile on Zortech and MSC compilers with only minor modifications. I
am currently working on PBLib to make is compiler-independent (which is not
all that easy since the Zortech that I have doesn't support inline assembly).
Anyway, the code should be straightforward to compile with the provided
makefile. Note that the only BULMAN source file is the BULETMAN.CPP. All
others are straight out of PBLib.
