I wrote the first version Listerz about a year ago and it proved to be quite
a popular product. The demand for more configurability grew and finally
evolved in the current LZSETUP separate setup program.

I also wanted to do a complete rewrite of Listerz in order to incorporate
some of the new advanced features of PB-Lib v3.0 such as the bucket file
buffering which allows all file areas to be transparently loaded in memory
without a noticeable sacrifice in performance. Unlike the previous versions
of Listerz, this one now supports all 10,000 file areas that ProBoard can
use. Also, the command bar classes have been fully utilized along with the
modified list viewer class which now supports windowed output. Another new
feature is the user-definable background screens which can be in ASCII, ANSI,
Avatar, PCBoard or Wildcat! formats. This versatility is due to the built-in
terminal from PB-Lib. I should also mention the useron support for UserDoes
and Doing (multinode systems). This built-in feature provides some online
information which can be used by these utilities.

This source code represents my first effort in using the Object Professional
library (version 1.10) from TurboPower Software. I think that I did quite
alright, although some code optimization may be in order. In the course of
developing the supporting routines for LZSETUP, several useful and generic
functions took shape and are now available as part of the toolkit for OPRO
also released by Silicon Creations, Inc. (along with the TurboVision kit).

The MANIFEST.DOC file outlines briefly the content of each file. Please,
look over it now to make sure that you have received all the necessary files.

In order to recompile LZSETUP, you will need the following wares:

	- Borland C++ 3.1 (a later version may work too)
	- Object Professional for C++ v1.10
	- PB-Lib v3.0 (a later version may work too)

Although I have not tested the source with any compiler other than Borland
C++ 3.1, it is reasonable to expect that it will compile with any later
version of BC (as long as it is DOS-based). I am not sure that the code will
even compile on Microsoft compilers. (It will not work with Watcom, Zortech
or Symantec because Object Professional does not support them at all). You
can get the current version of OPRO (C++) at a very low price (only $49)
from TurboPower Software (http://www.tpower.com). This discounted price is
due to them discontinuing development and support of all their C++ libraries.
Note that the documentation you get is excellent so you should not have any
trouble picking it up without assistance.

You will definitely need PB-Lib from Silicon Creations, Inc. in order to get
this program up and running. Several classes and routines from this library
have been used extensively throughout LZSETUP (such as the terminal emulator
class). You should be able to obtain the latest release of PB-Lib from the
same place you got this source code. For more information, refer to the
SUPPORT.DOC file. Note that you will not be able to use versions prior to the
3.0 release (some of the features are simply not there).

I have included the LZSETUP.PRJ file, although I did not use it to create
the distribution executable (I only used it as a single configuration file).
The reason for this is the size of OPRO. The IDE linker cannot link the
library as it is too big. I have provided a MAKEFILE which should be used
to do that instead. Note that TLINK distributed with Borland C++ 3.1 cannot
link it either as it runs out of table space. I have resorted to using the
TLINK that comes with Borland C++ 4.51 which works quite ok (note that it
also chokes if you try to compile with debugging information turned on).

The LZS_DATA.OPL file is the library file I used to store the dialog box
and menu configuration from MakeMenu and MakeScrn (these come with OPRO).
Note that the versions stored in this library are probably quite different
from the ones you see in the source code. This is due to the subsequent
revisions which I implemented straight in the code without using the two
utilities. The same applies to the stored color configuration (I know I
changed that manually too). The OPL file is provided for your convenience
and should be used as a secondary source only.

Possible improvements to the program include updating the help status line.
Right now, it only deals with menu items (i.e. when a dialog is popped-up,
it does not display context-sensitive hints). Since the status line was an
afterthought anyway, I decided not to waste valuable time investigating how
to implement the additional features. A full-blown help module is very easy
to do in OPRO but I think that it would be an overkill for an application
such as this one. Another possible thing which can arguably be termed an
"improvement" is to make the interface more like the JoHo-style it somewhat
mimics (JoHo = Joaquim Homrighausen). I don't think that this is readily
achieved with OPRO without some extensive additional programming. And last,
the color setup is very confusing. I should have probably gone with a single
dialog which groups all options. Oh well, maybe next time.

Have fun with the source code and I hope that you learn something from it!
