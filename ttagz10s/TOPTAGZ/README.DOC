This is the readme file for TopTagz source code. You will need to have
PB-Lib v2.0+ with the Classes add-on in order to use the source code.

Install with the command:

		pkunzip -od ttagz10s \sci\src

where '\SCI' should be your root directory for all SCI distributions, and
'SRC' is the standard source code directory.

Notes
=====

	TListBox is a generic list box to manipulate records which are
derived from TBaseRecord. It is used as it is (no changes) in all recent
programs I write. To use it, derive your class from TBaseRecord (just
as TTopFile is) and write the draw(), select() and deselect() functions
(and, toggleTag(), which is optional). Refer to the source code on how to
assign a list to it (TDoubleList) and how to make it process keystrokes.
Note that the TListBox::handle(); function recognizes all keys it needs
and will process them internally, it will ignore everything else.
