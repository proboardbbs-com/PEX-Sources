This is the "support.doc" file for all Silicon Creations products.  It
details how to obtain technical support for any PB-GNU program.

Before requesting support or contacting with problems, please be sure to
read and understand the manual. Most problems are often due to incorrect
data files and/or wrong command line parameters. Also, since most of the
programs are free, requests for new features and fixes will be given low
priority and work on them will be heavily dependent of time availability.

The following is a list of addresses in decreasing order of preference.

If you just want Silicon Creations software, ProBoard-related files
or technical support, login as 'GUEST" with password "SILICON". You
can also FREQ files. Get 'SILICON' for instructions and listing.

In addition, ProBoard-specific files can be found on

	ftp: wl.iglou.com//members/pbftp

Support message conference is available at Silicon Creations BBS.  Note
that there are dedicated sections for PB-Lib files/patches, etc.

ProBoard-related problems are discussed in the PROBOARD Fidonet echo which
I monitor. You can post a PEX-related problem there.

Please note that I am a full-time student and as such there may be a delay
in replying. I regret that, but there is nothing I can currently do about
it.
