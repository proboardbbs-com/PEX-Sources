                                 Description
                                 컴컴컴컴컴

ProTag is a PEX for ProBoard that allows users to add taglines to messages
entered using a full-screen editor.  It allows the sysop to add or
delete taglines from the database, and allows up to 30,000 taglines to
be stored in the master tagline database.  In order to maintain speed,
ProTag uses a master tag file, which contains your entire database of
taglines, and a smaller database of taglines that is used by the program
while the user is online.  A program is included that will randomly pick
taglines from the master tagline database, and copy them to the online
database.

                                Requirements
                                컴컴컴컴컴컴

-ProBoard 2.0 or higher
-Full screen editor such as GEdit, Pedit, IceEdit, or The Edit


                                 How it works
                                 컴컴컴컴컴컴

ProTag runs after a user enters a message using a full-screen editor.  The
user then chooses a tagline which is placed at the end of the message.

During your nightly maintenance event, PTMAINT.EXE will randomly extract
a sysop defined amount of taglines from a file called MASTER.TAG to a
file called PROTAG.TAG.  This allows you to have a VERY LARGE database
of taglines, but still maintain speed while a user is online.


                                 Installation
                                 컴컴컴컴컴컴

-Copy FSED.PEX, PTMAINT.EXE, and MASTER.TAG to your PEX directory.

-Run PTMAINT followed by the number of taglines you would like in your
 online database.  We reccommend a number between 250 and 500.

-You can optionally replace the header in the line that appears before
 tagline.  To do this, place your own header in the file PROTAG.CFG.

-GEdit requires additional command line parameters in PROCFG.  Here's
 what our command line looks like:

   *E *SGEDIT.EXE -S3200 *P *B.

 If you DO NOT have the *P and *B on the command line, GEdit WILL NOT
 work properly with ProTag.  ProTag has been found to work with Pedit,
 and IceEdit without modifing the command line.

| To use a PEX as a full screen editor, you just have to follow the PEX
| author instructions.

                             Using PTMAINT
                             컴컴컴컴컴컴

Large tagline files may take an extensive amount of time to search for
random taglines.  One solution to this is to use binary files rather
than text files, however, this does not allow the tagline file to be
easily edited by the sysop.  So, we decided to stay with the text files
and create PTMAINT.

PTMAINT will search a master tagline database called MASTER.TAG and
randomly copy a sysop defined number of taglines, to the online database
called PROTAG.TAG.  To run PTMAINT simply type PTMAINT followed by the
number of taglines you would like in the online database.  We reccommend
a number between 250 and 500.

Running PTMAINT during your nightly maintenance event is necessary
because ProTag does not randomly pick each tagline while the user is
online.  It simply picks a random starting point, and shows 15 taglines
sequentially from there.  By using PTMAINT nightly, the tagline search
will appear to be completely random.

PTMAINT also allows you to easily remove taglines containing certain
words from the database.  To do this, type PTMAINT /D followed by a
word.  All taglines containing that word will be removed from the
database.  For example, PTMAINT /D IDIOT would remove all taglines with
the word idiot in them.

                                컴컴컴컴

The included tagline database contains about 1,100 taglines.  Another
tagline database containing over 10,000 taglines is available from The
Power Supply.  You can freq TAGLINES from 1:377/64, or download it
online from the PowerPEX support area.

Now the famous part of all docs that SysOps just LOVE to pieces!
REGISTRATION!  Well, good news!  It's free!  We enjoy programming and we
LOVE ProBoard.  If you do decide to use this program, it would be nice
if you would send us a letter on our system telling us what you think
(comments, suggestions, etc.).  This is the way we know which of our
programs I should continue to support.  If we don't hear from you, we
will assume that no one is using this program and that we should
discontinue support for it.

Furthermore, we encourage other programmers to write FreeWare PEXes as
we have. ProBoard isn't a widely used BBS system, and the more FreeWare
utilities, the better for ProBoard!
