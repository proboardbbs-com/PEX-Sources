TFlagView, TFlagSelect (requires TurboVision)
=============================================================================

	Summary  Edit ProBoard-style access control flags.

	Remarks  TFlagSelect implements a class for a dialog where you can
	         select 32-bit flag values. All three states of the flags are
	         supported: on, off and reversed. The flag bits are selected
	         with the letters 'A' through 'Z' and the digits '1' through '6'.
	         The user can type in the letter (case-insensitive) or digit to
	         cycle through the bit states.  Also, the following special keys
	         are supported:  Alt+S sets all the bits, Alt+C clears all the
	         bits and Alt+R sets all bits to reverse. The flag mapping is
	         somewhat odd (but compatible with ProBoard). The bits from 31
	         to 6 are mapped to 'A' to 'Z' and from 5 to 0 are mapped to '1'
	         to '6'.  Don't ask me why, 'A'..'Z', '0'..'5' on 0..31 whould
	         have been easier, in my opinion, but this is what ProBoard's
	         author (Philippe) chose, so I decided to stick with it. You
	         can use the TFlagView class in the same fashion as a TInputLine,
	         i.e. you can insert it in your own dialog, attach a label to it
	         and won't have to call a separate dialog.


	TFLAGVIEW::TFLAGVIEW
	------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Summary  Constructs the flag input line.

		Syntax   TFlagView(const TPoint &where, long aFlags, long aFlagsRev);

		Remarks  The constructor creates a flag selection line and sets the
		         flag representation for aFlags and aFlagsRev respectively.
		         Note that some error checking is performed, and if a flag
		         is both set and reset, it is left off. The 'where' point
		         is the origin of the upper-left corner of the viewer. The
		         dimensions are fixed and cannot be changed by the user.


	TFLAGSELECT::TFLAGSELECT
	------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Summary  Creates the flag selection dialog box.

		Syntax   TFlagSelect(long aFlags = 0, long aFlagsRev = 0,
                             const char *aTitle = "Flags");

		Remarks  The constructor creates a flag selection dialog with the
		         initial values specified by the parameters. Note that a bit
		         is on in both the normal 'aFlags' and in the reversed set
		         'aFlagsRev', the effect is combined which leads to clearing
		         that bit.


	TFLAGVIEW::FLAGS, TFLAGVIEW::FLAGSREV
	------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Summary  Hold the flag bitmaps.

		Syntax   long TFlagView::flags;
                 long TFlagView::flagsRev;

		Remarks  These are directly accessible to the public. The first one
                 contains the flags that are set and the second one, the
                 flags that are reset.


	TFLAGSELECT::GETFLAGS, TFLAGSELECT::GETFLAGSREV
	------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Summary  Return the flag settings.

		Syntax   long getFlags() const;
		         long getFlagsRev() const;

		Remarks  The two functions return the flag settings from the
		         dialog box. When the execView() returns, and the result
		         was not cmCancel, you can retrieve the new flag values with
		         the getFlags() and getFlagsRev() functions. They both behave
		         similarly and simply return the bit-mapped long integers for
		         the flags and the reverse flags respectively.
