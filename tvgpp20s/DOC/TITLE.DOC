TTitleLine
=============================================================================

    This is a very simple class which allows you to put text on the
    title bar (normally used by the pull-down menu system). You only
    need to create on object with the appropriate text and insert it
    in your desktop. This is normally done in your application
    constructor. Here's an example (TMyApplication constructor):

               const char s[] = "I Am The Title!";
               TRect bounds   = getExtent();

               bounds.b.y = bounds.a.y + 1;
               bounds.a.x = bounds.b.x - strlen(s) - 1;
               insert(new TTitleLine(bounds, s));

    That's all there is to it. You can change the text dynamically
    with the newTitle() method.
