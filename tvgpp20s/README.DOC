This the the brief readme file which will simply introduce you to the
library. Note that you do not have to have any additional software (well,
except TurboVision, of course) to use this library.

TurboVision has been placed in the public domain by Borland International
and as such is freely available on the Internet. You need to obtain the
version 1.02, with the patches. Note that this library may not run on the
newer version 2.0. I have used the Borland C++ 3.1 compiler to develop it.

The DOC\ directory contains the individual manuals for the classes. The
EXAMPLE\ directory has all the source code examples that demonstrate how
to use the library correctly.

I have provided the makefile for Borland. Of course, since you must have
TV (and Borland) to use the library, it makes sense that the makefile is
in Borland-specific format.

The file LICENSE.DOC contains the full text of your user license. The file
SUPPORT.DOC contains the list of the current support sites as well as phone
and data numbers for getting in touch with me.
