INTRODUCTION
	Before requesting support or contacting with problems, please
	be sure to read and understand the manual. Most problems are
	often due to incorrect data files and/or wrong command line
	parameters. Also, since most of the programs are free, requests
	for new features and fixes will be given low priority and work
	on them will be heavily dependent of time availability.

ADDRESSES
	The following is a list of addresses in decreasing order of
	preference. Note that the Internet address is paid on a per
