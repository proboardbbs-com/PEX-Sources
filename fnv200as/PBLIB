PB-Lib Contents:
================

NOTE
	all utilities and functions come with a manpage which describes
	the correct usage and such. Those files are modelled after the
	UNIX manpages. All functions (except isAccess) will run both
	online (as PEXes) and offline (as EXEs). You can use isAccess()
	if you're running PBEMU, the ProBoard Emulator.

NOTE
	all the undocumented data files were hacked with LIST (not even
	a HEX editor ;-)) and their format is yet to be confirmed by
	Philippe. The structures work, however... as far as I tested them.

NOTE
	this library is released under GNU General Public License Version 2.
	C source code, examples, makefiles, project files and complete
	documentation must accompany each distribution, as per the original.
