  This document contains a list of all current support sites for programs
  from Silicon Creations, Inc. I have also listed some other points of
  interest in the Internet Sites section (these are places related to the
  ProBoard scene in general).

  Before requesting support or contacting with problems, please be sure to
  read and understand the manual that came with your software. I have taken
  great pains in ensuring that the instructions are as clear as possible
  and the programs are as intuitive as they can get. Most problems that
  people seem to encounter are often due to incorrect data files and/or
  wrong setup.

  Since all the programs are free, requests for new features and fixes will
  be given low priority and work on them will be heavily dependent on time
  availability.

  The following is a list of addresses and methods of contact. Note that the
  best way to reach the author is via netmail or email. All netmail replies
  will be returned in the manner that they are recieved (i.e. I will route
  replies to routed netmail and will crash direct replies to direct netmail).
  E-mail is probably the fastest as I check it at least twice a day and try
  to reply promptly to every message. The CompuServe address should only be
  used by other CompuServe members. Internet email sent to this address will
  NOT receive an answer (it will not even be read!) so don't do it (it costs
  me $$$ to send/receive e-mail at that address). Also note that I only check
  this place once or twice a week; so there may be a slight delay there.

  This is a (by no means comprehensive) list of some interesting ProBoard
  sites. Note that most (all) of them have links to other related places.
  I have only included the ones of special interest. If you want more, go
  to any of those and follow the links.

    http://www.proboard.com
        The official home of ProBoard. Maintained by Philippe Leybaert.
        Online plastic registration, development updates and links to
        most known ProBoard sites (nice MID music too :)

    http://www.pcmicro.com
        This is a huge site. Maintained by Mike Ehlert. All recent stuff
        appears there. Also, it has the biggest collection of RemoteAccess
        utilities (all of them can run under ProBoard). Also, thanks to Mike
        for providing the space for the official Silicon Creations, inc. FTP

    http://www.dma.be/p/bewoner/jmj
        The home site for all JMJ productions (most made by Ruben Provoost).
        This is the place where you will find the best chatter TheMin, as
        well as a lot of useful utilities (including the JMJLINE oneliner).

  Support message conferences are available at Silicon Creations BBS. Note
  that there are dedicated sections for PB-Lib files/patches, etc. Also,
  there are file sections with A LOT of ProBoard related files (from TGPBN,
  DqP, the filebone, and tons of hand-picked utilities).

  ProBoard-related problems are discussed in the PROBOARD Fidonet echo which
  I monitor. You can post a PEX-related problem there. You can also post
  messages to me in any of the TGPBN echo areas.

  Please note that I am a full-time student and as such there may be a delay
  in replying. I regret that, but there is nothing I can currently do about
  it. Sorry.

  All pex suggestions and bug reports can be sent by email or netmail,
  whichever you prefer. I will answer in the manner the original message was
  sent. Netmail may be an exception. I am known to make direct overseas calls
  if the message has a high priority and I will do that, as long as my
  resources permit it. However, I may reply via routed netmail in case the
  reply is not urgent. In that case, allow a couple of days for delivery.
  Also note that I do not like receiving InterNet email at my CompuServe
  address. I may not reply to those messages because I am charged for reading
  them (meaning, I may decide not to read them). Only use this address if you
  are a CompuServe member (in which case we're ok).

  A note for voice calls. Remember that there's a time difference and if you
  are calling from outside the US, make sure you are not trying to page me
  or talk to me in the middle of the night. Actually, late afternoon is the
  best time to call (this is in Central Standard Time). I do accept voice
  calls for software support (as lots of people know by now) but I really
  prefer email/netmail/echomail as it gives me an opportunity to go over the
  problem thoroughly and (in case of echomail), benefit more sysops with the
  reply/solution.
