This program is PB-GNU, which means it's free. The only requirement is that
if you use this program and find it useful, you send a post card of your
home town to the author. This request has always been a part of PBGNU, but
was buried in the documentation and people seemed to miss it. We can, of
course, do something like the PowerPEX guys, who required that you register
their program by calling their board and downloading a free key, but we
decided against it. Your support is appreciated.

I have had well over 100 file requests and downloads in the couple of
weeks that PBGNU has been alive and I am very pleased with the obvious
popularity of the project. I have requests from programmers that wish
to join in the effort and I have a lot of e-mail from people using those
programs. E-mail is nice, but postcards are better, so support your
favourite PBGNU programs by sending those to the author. Note that you
only need to send one postcard for all PBGNU programs from the same
author. I have released around 10 programs and if you're using them all
I do not expect 10 cards, but only one.
