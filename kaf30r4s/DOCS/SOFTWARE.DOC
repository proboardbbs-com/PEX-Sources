Binlog File Fixer fixes the ProBoard's BINLOG.PB file. Currently, it
removes all orphaned records (for users that are no longer present in the
userbase).

The Bulletin Manager was written to implement features that a lot of
Sysopsare looking for.  In fact, it was developed while writing and
reading messages with requests.  Very nice and configurable.

ÓNTÓRZ displays random (or user-selceted) 'press enter' prompt from a KaF
database (included).  Speed and location customizable.  This PEX is very
useful for replacement of the internal ProBoard prompt, as well as an
add-on for external programs that support it (TheMin 2.0 does).  The
included database provides 100 state-of-the-art animated prompts.

Fortune Cookie uses an ASCII database (BSD UNIX-compatible) to display a
quote with an optional logoff after that. Simple and nice. There are
additional data files available as FORT20D?.ZIP

The File List Generator creates listings of your file areas.  You can
createy our own header/footers - general and for the areas. Supports
multiple directories per file area. Speedy processing of CD-ROM areas.
Single-line listings available, can filter out ProBoard's line characters
(recognizes them as descriptions too). Many options, controlled fully via
UNIX-like command-line interface.

The File Navigator lets you view/search/tag/scroll/etc. etc. file groups
anda reas.  A lot of functions.  Once users see it, they just love it. As
with all Silicon Creations programs, visual appeal is so important that
this will be the first thing you'll notice.

KaFKa is the maintenance utility for KaF files (used by programs such as
ÓNTÓRZ and CÓLÓRiTY).  It has state-of-the-art fully menu-driven interface
and is very easy to use.  This is the tool you need if you want to create
your own animated prompts in KaF format that can be drop-in replacements
for the defaults shipped with ÓNTÓRZ and other programs.  The included
sample is the same as the one in ÓNTÓRZ and has 100 animated 'press enter'
prompts. Must see to appreciate.

The Key Navigator lets you implement keys from changing immediately to the
next or previous file/message area with or without regard to the current
group. Very nice, users like it.

Minesweeper is an implementation of the highly addictive Windows(tm) game.
Three levels as well as one user-configurable. Beautiful.

Password Enforcer is modelled after AIX passwd, it will enforce change of
password on expiration, write warning messages, etc. Lets you define the
minimum number of alphanumerics and special symbols. The maximum number of
duplicates from old password or repeats. You can become a real Cerberus
if you want to.

Physical Graffiti is a graffiti wall (oneliner) for ProBoard. Users can
enter lines and choose from 18 color definitions which are sysop-
configurable. Name is optionally shown, as well as time and date the line
was written.

Who Called is a very configurable Last Callers lister. Can print one, two
or three lines statistices.  Supports names and aliases.  Can export the
datato ANSI file.  Sort the listings with 4 different criteria. Proper
page breaks and nice colors. Multitude of options. EXE version can run
offline and PEX version to run within ProBoard.

PB-Lib is an extensive library for C/C++ programmers. Apart from functions
dealing specifically with ProBoard, it has a lot of other useful routines,
such as drive, file manipulation, multitasker support, string library,
CRC calculation, searching, sorting, etc. It comes with a couple of files,
be sure to get the documentation first, so you'll know what you need.

Std2Ext converts standard FILES.BBS listings to enhanced (extended or
CD-ROM format).  The standard listing includes file, optional download
counters and description.  The extended format adds file size and date to
the listing.  Very useful if you need to generate some FILES.BBS for the
ProBoard CD-ROM support and you only have the regular file.

MakeUtil is a package of makefile utilities that are required if you want
to compile the source code that comes with the distributions starting with
PB-Lib, September 1995. It has DMAKE - the variant of the UNIX "make" that
is used to do the maintenance, "cp", "rm" and "mv", which are equivalents
of the UNIX commands with the same names, startup configuaration files for
DMAKE, batch files to set the environment and documentation. If you are a
programmer, you might want to take a look at these.

ChkPRO is a utility that checks your ProBoard configuration records.  It
will process the file and message bases, the binary log and the general
configuration paths.  It can also repair some of the errors found.  This
file supercedes BinFix completely.
