This is the "install.doc" file which describes the standard directory
structure that is expected by all Silicon Creations software packages
distribution archives.

The home directory
------------------

The directory structure is designed to be very intuitive and easily
maintainable.  First, you need to decide upon a home directory.  This is
the directory where all Silicon Creations packages will install themselves
into. The default (suggested) path is \SCI on your hard drive (in my
case, this is C:\SCI).  You are not limited to the root directory of
your hard drve, but it is recommended that you use it so you can shorten
your PATH statement.  Once you choose your home directory, create it and
set the SILICON environment variable to point to it (I recommend you put
it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT).  A lot of the programs will be using shared
libraries and files, so if you observe the proper directory structure, all
of the installations will run smoothly.

Example:
	mkdir C:\SCI
	set SILICON=C:\SCI
	(add the last line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT to ensure it is always set)

Once you've done this, all the packages you receive must be installed with
the following command line (assuming you chose the default home):

	pkunzip -od <filename>.zip C:\SCI

This will create the necessary directories for the <filename>.zip package
and will install it into the Silicon Creations home directory.


The directory tree
------------------

Assuming you chose C:\SCI as your home directory, here's what the
directory tree underneath it will look like:

SCI				home directory (you choose it)
³
ÃÄÄBIN			various programs necessary for all packages
³
ÃÄÄDOCS			miscellaneous documentation (the common files will be
³				in the directory itself, and each package will have its
³				specific documentation in a subdirectory here
³
ÃÄÄLIB			libraries needed to compile the source code
³
ÃÄÄPBLIB		PBLib source code distribution
³
ÃÄÄTMP			temporary directory for program builds
³
ÃÄÄSRC			source code directory
³
ÃÄÄEXAMPLES		various example programs
³
ÃÄÄETC			configuration files
³
ÀÄÄH			header files common to all Silicon Creations software


Installing software packages
----------------------------

Every package you receive will be either binaries, source or both.  You
can determine what it is by looking at the name which is formed as
follows:  ccccnnnX.ZIP, where 'ccc' is four-character code representing
the package (unique for each one), 'nnn' is the version number and 'X' is
one of the following:  'S' - source code, 'X' - binaries, 'C' - both
source and binaries, 'D' - documentation, 'U' - additional utilities, and
'P' - something else (like data files).  Generally, you shouldn't care
about these since each package will be designed to install itself properly
into the home directory.

To install, use the command (assuming you have C:\SCI as root):

		pkunzip -od filename.zip C:\SCI


Supported compilers
-------------------

* Borland C++ 3.1 (keyword: bc31)
* Zortech C++ 3.0r2 (keyword: ztc3)
* Symantec C++ 6.0 (keyword: sc6)
* Microsoft C 6.0 (keyword: msc6)
* DJGPP (GCC) 2.60 (keyword: gcc26)
* Watcom C++ 10.0 (keyword: wc10)

Some of the software may not support all of the above but it will clearly
indicate so in that case.
