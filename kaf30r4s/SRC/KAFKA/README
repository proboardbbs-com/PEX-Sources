This is the 'readme' file for the KaFKa source code distribution.  The
code is not really commented, so use this if you have any difficulties.

Compilation
-----------
	You need to know Turbo Vision.  Period.  There's no way you can
understand the code otherwise (well, most of it anyway).  The way the
compiler options are set up now is as follows:  no debugging information
(.OBJ nor .EXE), use pre-compiled headers (goes up to 1.3 megs), optmize
for speed. Nothing fancy, really.
